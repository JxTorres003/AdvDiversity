# AdvDiversity
The Institute of  Advance Diversity

An online platform designed to connect individuals with the objective to provide personal
growth, entrepreneurship, career advice and much more by connecting them with mentors
across the world remotely.

## ðŸ§°  Worked on a full-stack task:
- Front End: Created Jobfair and Jobs page and forms.
- Middle Tier: Created models and controllers, connected MVC and proper functionally.
- Back End: Created tables and store prodecures for the jobfair data.  


I entered the project during its developement phase in the SDLC and due to its massive contibutions from other engineers I can only provide my portion of development.
