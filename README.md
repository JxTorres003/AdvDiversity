## ðŸ§°  Worked on a full-stack task:
- Front End: Created Jobfair and Jobs page and forms.
- Middle Tier: Created models and controllers, connected MVC and proper functionally.
- Back End: Created tables and store prodecures for the jobfair data.  


I entered the project during its developement phase in the SDLC and due to its massive contibutions from other engineers I can only provide my portion of development.
